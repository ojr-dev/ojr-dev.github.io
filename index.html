				<p><b style="font-size: 19px;">Fountas and Pinnell Reading Proficiency Performance:</b><br>The Fountas
					and Pinnell benchmark
					assessment is a system that was designed to conceptualize and mesaure student progress in achieving
					reading mastery. For this project, I used sample data spanning two schools, and two grade levels; my
					goal was to analyze the data and present trends and findings to stake holders, so that they could
					visualize the information and make sure the schools were on track with their reading progress.

				<p><b style="font-size: 19px;">Lariat Rent-A-Car Profit Strategies:</b><br>The case study on Lariat was
					designed around data from
					a fictional car company called Lariat. I examined data through an excel file about the car company;
					ranging from the details on each individual car, to rental sales made at each branch. I then created
					a data model that could be used to help decision makers reach their business objectives of
					increasing revenue and decreasing costs.

					may understand
					how to allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities. This project
					focused on using excel and statistical analysis to produce hypotheses and perform t-test on the
					variables; after which two hypotheses were selected to do a presentation on.

				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<p>
					As an enthusiastic Junior Software Engineer, I have developed a strong foundation in web application
					development,
					database management, and data analysis, which I continue to expand through hands-on learning and
					real-world
					applications. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and .NET Core, and I am particularly excited about
					deepening my
					expertise in <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> and other Microsoft services. Having worked on projects
					involving
					financial systems management and operational efficiency, I&#39;ve seen firsthand how technology can
					drive business
					success, and I&#39;m eager to contribute to innovative solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about cybersecurity and the critical role it
					plays in
					safeguarding modern digital infrastructures. I&#39;m currently pursuing a <strong>degree in
						Cybersecurity</strong>
					at <strong>Western Governors University (WGU)</strong>, where I am diving deep into the principles
					of data
					protection, ethical hacking, and secure software development. My academic journey has further fueled
					my curiosity
					in learning how to create robust and secure software systems. Alongside my formal education, I've
					completed the google cyber security
					certification and I am working towards earning <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> and enhancing my
					understanding
					of <strong>cloud solutions</strong>, reflecting my commitment to becoming a well-rounded engineer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I thrive on problem-solving, learning new technologies, and using data-driven decision-making to
					optimize software
					performance. Whether working on small code tweaks or large-scale software implementations, I
					approach every project
					with a proactive, detail-oriented mindset that drives results.
				</p>

				<h3 class="major">Career Goal</h3>
				<p>
					My ultimate career goal is to evolve into a proficient <strong>Software Engineer</strong>,
					specializing in
					<strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>, <strong>Microsoft services</strong>, and
					<strong>cybersecurity</strong>. I am driven
					by the desire to build secure, scalable, and efficient software applications that not only meet
					business needs but
					also help organizations achieve long-term success through innovation and technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					I&#39;m passionate about working with teams that share a focus on continuous learning and
					development, and I am eager to
					contribute my skills while learning from experienced professionals. As I continue to expand my
					technical expertise
					through both my degree at WGU and industry certifications, I aim to develop innovative, data-driven
					solutions that
					enhance cybersecurity, streamline operations, and make technology more accessible and secure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, I want to be part of a dynamic team where I can not only apply my current skills but
					also grow into a
					trusted engineer who leverages the latest technologies to address evolving business and security
					challenges. With a
					mindset focused on constant improvement, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and how
					I can contribute
					to the tech industry through impactful software engineering solutions.
